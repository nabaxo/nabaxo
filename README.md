### Hi there!

My name is Nebez Kassem (he/him) and I am a frontend developer with many years of experience in UX and UI design, Linux administration, and illustration.
My university studies were in 3D graphics and video games, so aside from 3D, I've also done things like video editing and post production.

**If it can be done on a computer, I've probably dabbled with it!**

Here's my website for more about me and other stuff I've made: <a href="https://nabaxo.dev" target="_blank">https://nabaxo.dev</a>
